## Pewlett -Hackard Analysis	

SQL HR Analysis

### Project Overview

### Purpose

Our Manager gave Bobby and me two more assignment: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, Then we will write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Result

We created SQL queries to generate employees number who get retiring soon by Title. While generating list we noticed that some entries duplicated for some employees. It is the reason of duplicated employees they changed titles over years.
